# Lidar-assisting-hand-held-device-for-visually-impaired-people
Visually challenged people are doing day to day activities with the help of cane type device. The weight of cane type device is high and  it is difficult for user to use. So, our aim is to design a hand-held device instead of cane type device. we created our own microcontroller PCB board by using Atmega328p.
