Visually challenged people face great difficulty in doing essential activities in everyday life.
Traditional cane type devices help them. 
Cane type devices are difficult to use and handle. 
We aim to design a handheld device instead of cane type device.
We are developing this device considering that they are only blind and not deaf. 
Visually challenged people to get all the inputs by hearing and sensing.
So, the device is designed so that the person can predict the output by two different ways, wired headset and buzzer.
We have interfaced ATMEGA328p with various kinds of sensors on our own designed and fabricated PCB Board.
The use of Printed Circuit Board increases life time, mechanically supported electrically connected circuit connections reduces wire joints, makes the device compact and durable.
Sensors include LIDAR Sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, DHT11 Sensor. LIDAR sensor accurately senses 0.2m to 8m with 90% reflectivity.
Coming to the battery and charging, we use the battery for the power supply.
The wired headset is used to notified the instruction to the user through voice.
